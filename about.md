Welcome to the I'm so lazy blog! My name is Justin Bansal and I write about life habits and ways to create a better lifestyle.

I'm a web developer from Toronto, Ontario. I enjoy playing sports, board games, traveling, and talking personal finance.

This photo is from my last trip to the States in December 2019. It's a crazy time in the world right now so I hope you are staying safe and keeping busy.

I am known to be a fairly lazy guy. As developers we are lazy individuals too. Why reinvent the wheel when we can reuse what someone else has already qualified to be a useful plugin that can add the functionality we're looking for in our project? We do this all the time.

Apart from developing I also play a lot of video games and watch a lot of movies. 

I've always heard of these "good habits" that successful people follow and wonder if they actually work. Reading about them is one thing but have you ever tried to make them your own? Join me as I look at different life habits and try to transform my lifestyle into one that keeps me healthy, motivated, and curious.

JB
