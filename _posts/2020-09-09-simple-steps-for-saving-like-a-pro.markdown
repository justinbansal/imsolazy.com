Saving money. It’s hard. It takes work. Not everyone does it. Maybe you do or maybe you’re told you should save but you haven’t gotten to it yet. You’re lazy. You want to save money but you just need some extra motivation to get started.

Don’t worry because I have been there before. But you can start saving today. Start before you think you’re ready. It’s simple.

I’m going to outline a few ways that you get started saving and through the process you will become more aware of your spending and be in better control of your finances. Saving money is important because it’s how you’re going to be able to achieve your financial goals.

You might want to buy any of the following:

- A car
- Go on a trip across Europe
- Buy your first home

But how are you going to do it if you are spending what you are making and have no savings? It’s fine to make six figures a year but if after tax you are spending all of your income on expensive things and have almost nothing left at the end of the year you’re in a pretty bad place. Your future won’t look too bright and you’ll just be working to maintain that expensive lifestyle.

Here are some interesting findings from the [2019 Canadian Financial Capability Survey](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/canadian-financial-capability-survey-2019.html) I found on the Government of Canada’s website.

- Nearly three quarters of Canadians have some type of outstanding debt or use a payday loan at some point over the last 12 months
- Almost one third feel that they have too much debt
- Some common types of debt include owing on credit cards (held by 29% of Canadians), vehicle loans or leases (28%, personal lines of credit (20%), and student loans (11%)

Debt is a big problem for Canadians and having savings that you can use for large expenditures can help you avoid taking on high-interest loans. The report states that “having a budget can help put in place a plan for how to afford [financial goals such as buying a home or condo as a principal residence, embarking on a home improvement or repair, taking a vacation, or purchasing a vehicle.]”

>I think one of the most important concepts to understand is that it’s not about how much you make but it’s about how much you save.

![Chart comparing poor people to rich people]({{ "assets/images/saving-money/chart.png" | absolute_url }})

I came across a similar comparison on social media one day so I recreated it here. Basically, people who are spending as much as they are earning are making bad financial decisions because they are left with nothing. They are not thinking about the future. In comparison, the wealthy people make sure to save their money and invest it so that they can grow their funds year over year.

#### So how do you start saving?

In order to start saving money you first need to figure out how much you are spending and where you're spending this money.

**1. List all of your expenses for the month**

The first step to tracking your expenses on a regular basis is to list out all of the expenses for the current month. You can do this with pen and paper, through an app, or through a spreadsheet. I find using a spreadsheet to be the best method. It makes it easy to do calculations, and I use Google Sheets so I can access them virtually anywhere.

![List your expenses ]({{ "assets/images/saving-money/list.jpg" | absolute_url }})
<span>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Glenn Carstens-Peters</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/list-expense?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span>

I have six columns that I add to my spreadsheet so that I can get the full picture on every expense. These include the date, the expense amount, the restaurant or establishment at which the purchase was made, a description/reason for the expense, and a final column for any comments that I need for myself.

Here’s an example:

Name | Amount  | Date  | Reason  | Category | Comments

- Expense name: Airbnb Cottage 
- Amount: $131.00 
- Date: 8/28/19 
- Reason: Initial deposit 
- Category: Personal 
- Comments: Make sure to send out an email to everyone so they can pay me back

I log in to my banking portal and view my account statements as well as my credit card statements to get the details of every transaction for the month. For cash transactions having a receipt is really important. I have an envelope of receipts for every month labeled with the month on the outside and I keep it in my desk drawer. When I need to fill out my expenses it’s really easy to open the envelope and have all of the receipts I need. This also helps me keep my wallet less cluttered and prevents me from misplacing receipts that I usually would leave somewhere on my desk.

**2. Categorize your expenses**

Once you have the list of expenses you then need to figure out the total amount spent by category. Thanks to the category column we have an easy way to filter the spreadsheet and get the sum of all the line items. You can do this in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets or any other spreadsheet software you are using.

Once you see the expenses by category you start learning more about the way you spend your money. For instance, you might notice you spent $200 this month on dining out. That might come like a shock to you because you never really noticed how much you were spending when going out. In the moment, it’s so easy to use your credit card and pay for that expensive dinner. However, once you do it a few times it can really add up. This knowledge might help you look at a few ways of saving money like cooking more meals at home, limiting the amount of times you dine out, or opting for an occasional potluck with your friends.

**3. Make adjustments**

Once you have gotten the data and then broken it down into separate categories it really informs you on your spending behaviour. Now it’s up to you to make adjustments where you feel you can save some money. It might not be a good idea to limit yourself completely on all the things you enjoy because then you’d just hate your lifestyle. Creating a balance is key.

Here are some examples of ways you can save money with ordinary expenses:

##### Car insurance
- Sometimes your location can really impact your rates so there’s not much you can do unless you’re ready to pack up and move to a different city
- You can still research insurance rates to see what competitors are offering 
- Is your current package the best option for you right now? Do you need full coverage if you have a 10 year old car? In some cases, a basic coverage would make more sense and could save you as much as $80/month which equates to $960 a year (based on Desjardins insurance rates)
- Do you need insurance on multiple cars? If you find that you’re using one car primarily for grocery shopping and a few errands you may be able to save by storing the other vehicle. Many insurance companies offer this storage option. You won’t be able to drive the car for the storage period but you can save as much as $40 a month. When we were on lockdown because of COVID-19 many people chose this option to save some money.

##### Home phone

- Many of you may not have a home phone anymore but some with older parents may still have them around
- If your parents are calling family back home and you’re being charged for each long distance minute it may be beneficial to look into a VOIP service
- It’s often too expensive or limited to add a long distance package to your regular home phone package but a VOIP service can include this all for unlimited usage
- I’ve been using [Vonage](https://www.vonageforhome.ca/) for the past few years and couldn’t be happier

##### Cable/Internet

- Companies are often running promotions throughout the year so just by calling your provider and asking for a discount you can end up with a $20 credit on your account for the next 12 months. All it takes is a simple call. The downside is the wait time to get a hold of one of the customer service reps is quite long but if they have a callback option it’s not too bad. A $20 credit saves you $240 for the year.
- There’s so many [alternatives to cable](https://millennialmoney.com/best-alternatives-to-cable-tv/) that can save you money. If you find that you’re watching most of your content on Netflix it may be time to cut the cable and save big time.

##### Subscriptions

- Instead of signing up for individual accounts for things like Netflix, Crave, or Spotify, try to sign up for the family plan or share the account with other family members
- Spotify allows you to have up to six people on its family plan so you can spend $15 as a group each month or $10 individually. You still get your own account, playlists, and catered feed so it's a win-win!

##### Gym membership
When the gyms closed as a result of COVID-19 many people turned toward [working out at home](https://imsolazy.com/2020/09/01/how-to-work-out-at-home.html). If you find that you are using your gym membership often then continue doing so because it’s part of your healthy lifestyle. However, if you find that you’re not going often or not at all, consider [working out at home](https://imsolazy.com/2020/09/01/how-to-work-out-at-home.html) to get that same burn.

##### Cell phone / plan

- Track your data usage for the month and see if you really need that expensive data plan. With more of us at home with access to wifi there may be less need for a 10GB plan. There’s also a ton of providers out there so if you can save by going from Rogers down to Fido or even Chatr make the switch. Because Rogers owns those lower-tier companies you still get the same great reception.
- I switched to Public Mobile a few years ago and the service has been great. The best part is that I receive discounts on my monthly bill for referring new people, for paying with my credit card ahead of time, and for sticking with them year after year. You even get discounts for participating in their support forums and answering questions that help other customers! [Sign up with Public Mobile today](https://activate.publicmobile.ca/?raf=WN64J0).
- Opt for an unlocked phone. If you’re looking for used phones you can check out Facebook Marketplace or [getOrchard](https://www.getorchard.com/). You can save almost as much as the cost of a new phone by using an unlocked phone and going with a more affordable phone plan. A $50 monthly plan plus a $25 monthly tab to factor in the new phone will cost you as much as $1800. Just the tab alone will cost you $600 over the two years. This is in comparison to a $35 plan with Public Mobile and buying a $300 used iPhone off of getOrchard.
- With things like planned obsolescence and advertising influencing people to think they need to buy a new phone every couple of years people will be spending thousands of dollars on phones for years to come. 

##### Bank account

- Have you ever looked at your account statement and noticed a monthly bank account fee? You could be spending hundreds of dollars a year in banking fees. This means your bank is charging you for keeping your money with them. It’s outrageous but often people are too lazy to change things so they just let costs like these fly by. 
- If you recently finished school you’ll notice that your bank account got changed and they would have introduced new fees. Often you can avoid fees if you maintain a minimum balance of a couple thousand dollars. But then you have $3,000 just sitting in the bank account and it’s not working for you.
- I was tired of dealing with the big banks so I made the switch to Tangerine and there’s been no fees and no hassles. I still have a savings account with TD but do all of my regular banking at Tangerine. I love that there’s no fees and that email money transfer is free. A $15 monthly bank account fee at TD would have cost me $180 in the year! Signing up is easy and every time you refer someone to Tangerine you get a free $50 bonus!

**4. Create a budget**

It’s important to set up a budget and stick to it. This will help you early on when you’re trying to get a better grasp of your finances. There are many different apps and tools available online to help you get started with a budget. A few of the ones I’ve used include [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) and [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/). But I was never consistent in using them and felt that I needed a more hands-on approach that I enjoyed. 

I love spreadsheets and use them for everything so I set up my own budget using Google Sheets. You first have to decide how much money you’re going to allocate to this budget. 

When I started I set an amount in X dollars and said that for this month I am going to spend no more than $400 on personal things. This is separate from things like rent, phone bill, car insurance, or your gas bill.

Remember how I said I had an envelope for receipts for each month? I also add the $400 cash to the envelope at the beginning of each month. 

When I go out and spend money, I’ll come back and add the receipts for the transactions to the envelope. But then I make sure to withdraw the amount spent from the envelope. So if I went to dinner and spent $30, I have to take $30 out of the budget envelope. This shows me visually that I have only $370 left. I find that this makes it more apparent that I’ve spent the money. I find the effect is stronger if you just avoid using your credit card when going out. If I instead were to take the cash with me and then pay $30 in cash for dinner, I become more aware of that loss or of that expense. This is just a technique that works for me so you don’t have to follow suit but I do recommend trying it out.

Setting a budget and sticking to it requires strong self-discipline but you can do it. You just have to start. The first step is tracking your expenses and becoming aware of where you’re spending your money. Then you have to try to limit that spending to a reasonable amount using a budget. It may not work out the first few months but you’ll eventually figure out what works for you.

**5. Make it automatic**

Once you have figured out that you can cut back in expenses in a few categories you can then set up a savings plan through your bank account. Make it automatic! You can set up an automatic savings plan for any amount and set the frequency to your liking. Most bank portals make this really easy. For instance, you can set it up so that $200 is taken from your checking account each month. You can make this transfer between banks if you have more than one bank or between accounts.  Within one bank you can have a number of different accounts and even name them differently. If you wanted that $200 to be used for a travel fund, you can name the account you are transferring to as ‘My Travel Fund’. I used this strategy early on so visually I could see the different accounts I had and how they were growing as the savings went on.

> How much you save will really depend on your situation. But I remember the advice I got after reading [David Bach’s ‘The Automatic Millionaire’](https://amzn.to/2GEgMDP) was to pay yourself first and to aim for 10% of your income. Even Warren Buffet says “Don’t save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving.” This principle is important so that you can make sure you are contributing to your savings plan rather than working to simply pay bills. And once it’s automatic you really don’t have to worry about much.

**6. Review and repeat**

After going through these steps you will have:
- Learned where you are spending your hard earned money
- Set up a budget to get your spending in control
- Cut back on certain expenses saving you hundreds of dollars a year
- Set up an automatic savings plan to reach your financial goals

You can review the plan on a monthly basis and see if things are working out. If you notice that your budget is too strict or you would like to save more, you can definitely tweak things. Maybe you get a salary raise and can afford to increase your contributions to your savings. Maybe you want to start investing so instead of putting $200 a month into a savings account, you diversify and put $50 into an index fund, $100 into a mutual fund, and the rest into your savings account.

The key is to start and to remain disciplined with this approach. Eventually you will thank yourself for getting started and once you see the savings grow it will bring a smile to your face.
