#### What is this blog about?
Welcome! This is my first post on the imsolazy blog. This is a place where I will go over some of the "bad habits" that I've taken on and want to transform into good, positive, and productive habits. I think it's time for a change and I want you to join me on this journey as I try to change my behaviour and overall live a better life.

To get started, I wanted to go over the definition of a "habit". Wikipedia defines a habit as the following:

>"A routine of behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subsconsciously." 

So what are good habits? The Medical dictionary defines them as:

>"A behaviour that is beneficial to one's physical or mental health, often linked to a high level of discipline and self control."

I think the difficult part of having good habits is maintaining them through self-discipline and being consistent with the behaviour. I've struggled to keep consistent whenever I try to change my behaviour. Whether that's reading a book or going to the gym or just eating healthy. I may do it for a month or two but I end up quitting.

Why is it so difficult to be consistent and to change the status quo? It feels easier for me to just eat whenever I want, even when I'm full. It feels easier for me to just sit around instead of going for walks and runs. It feels easier for me to just go to work and then come home and watch television instead of engaging my mind in new activities and picking up new skills. But then there's also all the things that I want to achieve and try out. The only way to get there is by taking action today and to change the behaviour so that I can create a new lifestyle for myself.

I've often heard that if you stick with something for 21 days then it will become a habit. And if you stick with it for 90 days it becomes effortless. This blog will document my habits and track my progress as I attempt to transform each one into a good habit. I'll provide as much as information as possible on my progress and a new blog post will be published each week.

#### The bad habits

Here's a list of my bad habits:
- Sleeping late (between 12am and 1am)
  - What is late really? I think it depends on the person but I think if you plan to wake up at 6am and want to get 8 hours of sleep, then anything past 10pm would be late. When do I want to wake up? That's the difficult part because I never really stick to a consistent schedule. Why am I staying up late? Well it can be a number of factors but the main reason this year has been gaming online with friends. And this is new for me. But I also think Covid didn't really help. 
  
  - With quarantine and everything going on, gaming with friends was a social outlet for me. It was the one way I was able to consistently socialize with friends and play some games for entertainment. It kept me happy and I continued to do it. Eventually it became an addiction where I was playing every night at the same time for 2-4 hours a night and a lot more on the weekend. For some people this is Netflix or spending hours watching YouTube videos.

- Waking up late (around 8-815am, sometimes later)
  - This is a direct result of sleeping late. I set alarms on my iPhone every night and it's sitting right beside my bed (another bad habit). The issue is that I end up hitting snooze and delay waking up until the very last minute. I would love to get up earlier so that I can cook myself a nice breakfast or go for a run or even get started at work a bit earlier than usual. I literally wake up late and frustrated because I let myself sleep in longer than I planned. I'm not going to be setting any crazy goals to start waking up at 5am but I do want to get up earlier than before. I want to improve my morning routine to make myself more effective during the day.

- Snacking which used to be a late night behaviour but has now become a constant habit
  - This is a pretty bad one. This goes hand in hand with playing games late into the night. I start to get hungry and then I want to grab a snack. When I go to the kitchen and see some chips or popcorn, I'm going to grab them and dump them into a big bowl. This part was really exciting. Not measuring the food or worrying about how much I was eating but just taking it all and getting it into a bowl and hurrying back up to play games was fun! This eventually got worse and every night I would have 1-2 bowls while playing games. Think about all those extra calories I was taking in? It felt good in the moment but the day after would feel terrible. I would feel upset because I wasn't able to control myself. I think that's another thing. Even though I take some time to be aware of these things and have said I would change my habits, when I'm in the moment I just end up saying something like "I'll do it tomorrow". So I just keep putting it off and time will go on so it becomes a never ending cycle.

- Minimal exercise, has varied throughout Covid, basically a walk once a day now
  - This one is like my diet and goes up and down and up and down. Just before Covid, I had a few months of consistency where I was going to Goodlife at 6:30am and keeping track of my diet. Once the gyms closed I stopped waking up early and just became lazy. I stopped exercising for months. Then I started doing some full body workouts at home guided by YouTube videos but this was only a couple times a week. Then for a few weeks I did bike rides and it was fun, easy, and I was doing it almost every other day. However, this also eventually stopped and now the only thing I've been doing regularly is walking once a day for something like 20 minutes. When I was at the gym, I used to weightlift 3-4 times a week so not having done that for the last few months is huge. I feel lazy, less willing to do new things and I think another result from this is frustration. I've read that you get more stressed ignoring the things that you should be doing. By putting off the behaviorus I want to change I'm only stressing about them more. Not exercising for me kept everything bottled up whereas it used to be a helpful release from work and other areas of my personal life. This lack of exercise prevented me from thinking creatively at work and kept me feeling sluggish.

- Poor diet, no cooking, pop, beers, snacks, ice cream, lots of sweets
  - So I did mention that I was snacking late into the night and not exercising but my overall diet goes up and down and lately is just terrible. I will eat just about anything and multiple times a day. If I'm bored I'll eat. If I'm depressed I'll eat. If I'm watching tv I want to eat at the same time. And I don't track my calories so I think this will result in me putting on more weight. The negative here is increasing my daily intake of calories and not watching what I'm eating. I love both sweet and salty things so I'm often consuming a lot of ice cream and chips in the evenings and on weekends.

- Minimum 8 hours sitting on computer
  - As a web developer I'm on the computer 8 hours a day and then if I was gaming this would be 10-12 hours a day in the same seat, with another few hours watching tv in the living room. There was a lot of sitting and a lot of screen time overall. If I'm not on my laptop, I'm on my desktop, or I'm on my phone, or I'm watching tv. It feels hard to try to escape the screen. Even if I'm trying do something productive like writing a blog or managing my finances using a spreadsheet, it's going to involve the computer which makes it difficult to avoid that screen time.

- Using the phone in bed
  - I do this every night and I get into bed and I start browsing on my phone. I check Instagram, Facebook, sometimes my work email (why?), and then I might start watching something on Netflix. So after a day of at least 8 hours on just the computer, I'm spending another 30-60 mins on my phone in bed. And nothing I'm doing is really productive. One thing I always do is read an article on Covid before going to bed. And this is terrible because I don't see how reading about a global pandemic is going to help me sleep better at night. We're just surrounded by so much of it that it's important to take a break and think of other things.

#### Bad habit to good habit?

So how do you turn a bad habit into a good one? How do you stop an addiction or break a routine and start creating positive change? I think the first step is taking action and taking action today, now. And to maintain that behaviour for at least 21 days while tracking the progress. I think holding myself accountable through this blog will also help me stay focused.

One of the biggest problem areas I feel is my lack of fitness and poor diet. This one I feel is also the toughest to change because I have been doing it for so long and making poor choices regularly.

I think in order to create change I will have to do the following:
  - Track my diet so I'm aware of how many calories I'm consuming. I used to track my calories through the myFitnessPal and LoseIt apps but I stopped doing it at some point. I'm going to have to pick an app or keep a notepad with me and make sure to track this information regularly for 21 days. Even just taking a photo of the meal before I eat it will help me keep a log of the food and I can easily add that info to the app at a later time.
  - I think starting with 30 mins of exercise each day is a good first step into making that a regular part of my day. If I say an hour I think it's going to steer me away. 30 minutes sounds like a lot but it's equivalent to one episode of a tv series. It's doable. I just have to push through and work my way up to 30 minutes.
  - Eventually though I would like to increase this amount to be an hour of exercise each day.
  - What kinds of things could I do? Because it's still warm outside I could go for a jog or ride my bike. There's plenty of full body exercises that I could do. I've also purchased fitness bands that I've used a handful of times. I've also watched YouTube videos and followed along.
  - I know that if I exercise in the morning before work I will have an easier time checking that off. If it ends up being after the work day I tend to get lazy and put it off until the next day.

#### Taking Action

So I understand my past behaviour and I know what I want to achieve but the hard part is really taking action. How do you make this happen? Well this blog is going to hold me accountable and I really want to try doing this for 21 days and track my progress. I will post my diet logs to the blog and also report the exercise I have been doing.

I know I want to achieve 30 minutes of exercise and get it done in the morning so I'm going to have to really push myself to wake up at a decent time. By setting an alarm for 7:30am I know that I have ample time to get up and get a workout in before I start work at 9am. This also means I have to push myself to get into sleep at a reasonable time, let's say 11:30pm. These are more changes then I would like to have happen but looks like for this to work out effectively, I'll need to get these few things in order!

I also know that music will help me on my runs because I find cardio really boring so I'm going to make sure to keep my earbuds charged the night before along with my phone and my Apple watch. I have an old Apple watch that I'm bringing out to serve as a fitness band and help me track my exercise and calories.

Throughout the day I can think of few times where my phone is not on me so if it's already with me while I'm having a meal I just need to get into the habit of adding what I ate to the app. This is going to require self-discipline but I'll take it one day at a time.

Tracking calories for everything I eat and drink is the first step in my 21 day challenge.

After that I'd like to remove certain things from my diet
  - No pop
  - No juice
  - No alcohol
  - No snacks of any kind (candy, chocolate, chips)
  - No dessert (cake and ice cream)
  - Limit takeout food

Here's some of my current stats:
- Weigh 180 lbs
- 36.5'' waist size
- Daily walk of 20 minutes
- No diet logging
- Consuming lots of food regularly

I think that's it for now. I'll publish my next post a week later with some progress on my goals of exercising 30 minutes a day and tracking my diet. Thanks for checking in!
