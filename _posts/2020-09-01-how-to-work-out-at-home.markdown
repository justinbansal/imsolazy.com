Working out at home can be a great alternative to going to the gym. You may not want to go to the gym for a variety of reasons:

- It costs money
- It takes too much time to travel back and forth
- It might be intimidating working out among others
- You don’t like waiting to use the equipment
- You don’t feel motivated enough to leave the house

But is working out at home as effective as going to the gym? Yes it totally can be if you put in the work to see results. And you don’t need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to get yourself there. It really depends on what you want your home gym to look like. If you don’t want to spend a dime you can just do bodyweight exercises. 

These are strength training exercises that use your own weight to provide resistance against gravity. This is compared to you lifting weights like barbells and dumbbells. In comparison, this type of training requires no equipment and you can still workout nearly every muscle in your body.

Where do you start? Here’s a chart of 42 bodyweight exercises that you can perform at home. Source: [https://darebee.com/](https://darebee.com/).

Even if you’re a complete beginner you can choose five exercises from the chart above and target different muscles to get a full body workout.  Figure out how long you want the session to be (10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins) and then pick the moves.

For a 10 minute session, you would want to perform each exercise for 30 seconds, followed by a 30 second break. You can then repeat this once more so you perform each exercise twice. If you find that you need more of a break you can adjust this to have a 60 second break.

Using a stopwatch or timer on your phone you can time yourself and make sure to breathe with every move.

### Here are some of the top bodyweight exercises you can do:

#### Push-up

You can do this one on your toes or on your knees to start and as you get stronger you can move to being on your toes. For this exercise you are propped up on the floor using your hands and toes with your back straight. Your hands can be just outside of shoulder-width apart and you want to make sure your arms and legs are straight.  Lower your body until your chest touches the floor and then bring yourself back up.

#### Burpees

This one is a bit more challenging and really gets your heart pumping but once you complete it you feel really good. Keeping your feet shoulder-width apart you start off in a squat position so that your thighs are parallel to the ground. Then you drop to the floor and do a push-up. Bring yourself back up into the squat position and then jump straight up.

#### Squats

This one is an important one because it targets so many important muscles (quads, hamstrings, glutes, abs, and calves). Squats will help you increase strength, improve hip mobility, build muscle, and burn fat.

Set your feet to be shoulder-width apart with your toes facing outward. Slowly bend your knees and lower your body, keeping your heels flat on the floor. Make sure to have your hips back so that you are not pushing your body forward. Then bring yourself back to the starting position.

If you vary the intensity, the number of reps, and rest time you can build out a great workout routine that will certainly show results.

If you want to get some equipment that is relatively cheap and takes up very little room in your space, think about getting the following:

- Exercise mat 
  -  It really helps to have this when you are doing exercises on the floor like planks or anything targeting your lower body. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy but should be comfortable to lie down on.
- Exercise ball
  - This is a great tool for those core exercises.
- Dumbbells
  - If you’re a complete beginner make sure to start with a light pair of dumbbells so that you can get the form down for each exercise before lifting too heavy.
- Fitness bands
  - These aren’t too expensive and you only need one to get started. It can be more affordable than dumbbells and easier to get started working out because you control the resistance. There are a few different types of bands such as mini bands, superbands, and resistance bands with handles.
- Exercise bench
  - Again this is not necessary but a nice addition to a home gym. You can do lots of exercises without a bench and a regular stool at home will work for some things.
- Fitness tracker
  - This is a nice addition if you want to capture data. It’s great to know where you started and track your progress so something like a Fitbit might be a good purchase if you’re just getting started.

### Tips for working out at home

#### Be consistent
Building consistency is challenging but if you schedule your exercise time into your calendar it will help keep it top of mind and make you motivated to get it done. You can set up calendar notifications to your email or phone as reminders. By having a set day for working out you can also prepare the night before by having your “gym bag” ready to go. You can set aside your gym clothes and workout equipment so that once you wake up you’ll have everything you need to get started. You’ll also be reminded as you pass by the equipment that you still need to get your workout done for the day. If you schedule it for earlier in the day you’re also more likely to get it done because you are more motivated and fresh in the morning. 

#### Start small
Start with baby steps so if that means just working out once in the week, start with that. Start with small goals and slowly build that up into something you’re comfortable with like three workouts per week. If the goal you set is beyond reach everything will fall apart and you’ll feel demotivated to start again. You don’t have to feel intimidated either when you are working out at home - there is no one there to judge you so if you are starting slow and doing short workouts in the beginning that’s perfectly fine.

#### Workout space
Try to have a designated workout space that is always setup and ready to go or at least make sure it is set up the night before. If you find yourself having to spend time to get that workout space ready it may demotivate you because it involves more work. Using the same space will help build consistency so you can keep going with your workout program.

#### Workout outfit
Wear your favourite workout outfit, splash some water on your face to get you feeling awake if you’re still a bit tired, and play some upbeat music to get you feeling energized and in the mood. You can then enjoy a pre-workout snack and get started. Once you’re done make sure to have a post-workout snack like a protein shake and refresh with a shower.

#### Wear shoes
Even though you’re inside, working out in shoes will help properly support your knees and feet through the exercises and also create familiarity with what you’re used to at the gym.

#### Remove distractions
If you’re using your phone, turn on ‘Do not disturb’ mode so that you are not getting work emails and texts that will take away from your workout time. You can still use your phone to play music or as a timer but try not to get distracted by those things that you can always check after your workout. This is your dedicated exercise time so use it effectively.

#### Don't neglect certain muscles
Try not to neglect some body parts so just as you might have different workout days at the gym (shoulders, back, legs, etc) do the same at home. There are a ton of videos you can watch to guide you through a session that just targets one body part.

#### Take your time
Starting with baby steps also means that you shouldn’t be too hard on yourself. It’ll take time to get results and time to learn the right form. Take this time to look up different videos and get the form right. If you don’t like the video, switch it off and play a different one. Once you get the form down you can increase the intensity. Take your time, don’t rush through the exercises, follow the cues, and remember to breathe. Just stay consistent.

Don’t forget to warm up and end with some recovery exercises. 

### Start simple

If you haven’t been working out for a while and find yourself in a rut, just start with something simple like a walk. This will get you outside, feeling that fresh air and pumping blood through your system. As your body releases those endorphins you will feel refreshed and motivated. You get motivated to do better for your body and you feel good. Walking is a great low impact exercise that can help you get into a new fitness routine. If walking seems boring grab your earphones and listen to some music or podcasts while you walk. You may find that walking with no music is a relaxing outlet for you as you just observe life and let your mind wander.  Some other ways you can get started is by going for a bike ride, using that treadmill that may be collecting dust in your basement or by going for a jog.

### Follow along with a workout video

- These guys are great because they have a variety of videos
- Full length workouts with them doing the exercises really helps you keep going. If they’re not stopping you shouldn’t either
- They do a good job of describing the exercises and providing modifications in case you find something too challenging
- There is an app available in case you just want to use your phone and don’t have access to a TV nearby

#### POPSUGAR Fitness

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3F6R92s6_o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- They also have a lot of great content and what sets them apart is they bring in professionals to join them for the workout. The professional takes over the class and guides you through the workout
- They also provide modification exercises for those finding the regular workout too challenging
- Exercising can get boring when you do the same ones over and over and POPSUGAR makes it fun because they offer HIIT videos, low impact and high impact cardio, kickboxing, and even mix in some dance steps 

#### Group HIIT

- The videos vary in terms of difficulty and offer a ton of exercises you can do with or without weights at home
- There is no music but they have a very simple layout with a countdown timer and beeps to notify you of the next exercise

### Get moving with friends and family

#### Start a WhatsApp challenge
100 day push-up challenge: complete 100 push-ups each day for 100 days. Once you finish your push-ups the first day message the group with a ‘1’. The next day you post a ‘2’ and then it keeps going until you get to 100. You can do the push-ups all at once or break them down into sets. Doing something like this makes you feel apart of a bigger group, it can get competitive, and completing 100 days of 100 push-ups is a huge accomplishment to look back on. You can also set it up to a combination of 25 squats, 25 jumping jacks, 25 push-ups, and 25 sit-ups, whatever you like! 

#### Work out in a virtual room
There’s many resources out there like [Watch2Gether](https://w2g.tv/?lang=en) where you can set up a virtual room, invite others, and watch the video in sync. This is great because you’re less likely to pause a workout video when you have a few other people watching the same video. If you pause the video, it will pause it for the others as well!. It also holds you accountable to attending the session because you’ve planned it ahead of time and your friends will be waiting for you before getting started.
