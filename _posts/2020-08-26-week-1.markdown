Here’s a one week recap of my efforts to eat healthier and exercise for 30 minutes each day.

To skip the full recap you can read **[10 things I've learned from this week](#10-things-ive-learned-in-the-last-week)**.

It hasn’t been easy. Waking up early especially was a challenge. I think I can get it down during the week but because I tend to stay up late on weekends, it messes with my schedule come Monday. This is something I know I need to work on. 

### Day 1 - Sunday August 16

I don’t work weekends so this made my day go a bit easier. I was able to sleep in a bit but still wake up at a reasonable time. 

**Here’s my exercise stats:**

| Workout type  | Running |
| Duration   | 32 minutes |
| Distance   | 4.6km     |
| Estimated calorie burn | 291  |

This information was tracked using a 1st gen Apple watch. I realize I need to start a workout on the watch in order for it to start tracking properly. I was under the impression it would start tracking whenever I started moving during the day. It doesn’t seem like it’s always accurate but I think it’s better than nothing and I feel it’s important to capture this data so I can look back and see what I’ve accomplished.

I won’t lie. This jog was tough and I was breathing hard! I took a few breaks and walked but I made sure to stay out there for about 30 minutes. It felt good once I was done. I’m nowhere near able to do 10km yet but I think 4.6km is a great starting point. 

Here’s some of the things I was thinking of before getting out there:
- I need to do 30 minutes of exercise and I chose to run because I noticed my stamina had dipped in recent months
- I want to run because I hardly do it and in the past I used to at least do 10-15 mins on the treadmill before working out at the gym
- I could easily just do some strength training but I knew I would just be avoiding the fast-paced cardio
- It’s boring but I have a whole Sunday ahead of me so I just gotta get through these 30 minutes
- Once I’m done I can take a nice shower and get on with my day
- I’ve got my phone and earbuds loaded with some music so that will help keep me moving 

**Here’s what I ate that day:**

I used LoseIt to log my meals and am proud that I was able to do it regularly for a week. I’ve also used myFitnessPal in the past so both are pretty much the same in my opinion. I turned on reminders for meal plan logging in myFitnessPal sometime last year and still have it running. I thought those would be a neat way for me to remember to log my meals but it’s been several months and I’ve just learned to ignore them or swipe them away. 

Another thing I tried was to have the app placed on the main dock so that it was one of the four apps closest to the home button.

This didn’t really do anything either :(

But now that I’m actively trying to log my meals it is located in a convenient place. 

The app is fairly easy to use and you can create your own meals but I haven’t found the need to do that since their database has almost everything available.

So some meals are a bit tougher to track so I just estimate as best I can. For example, when I have my mom’s roti and sabji for dinner, I’m not entirely sure how much calories I’m consuming. However, rotis are items in the LoseIt database and then you just need to figure out an estimate for the sabji.

Because I’m lazy I’m not trying to make any dramatic changes to the diet but I’m trying to have regular meals, watch what I’m eating, and just make sure to track it. If I can avoid some of the sweets and salty snacks, that’s a bonus! 

As I’m going through this experience I think it would be helpful for me to analyze the data and figure out how much protein I’m consuming on a daily basis. I’ve read that you should have 1g of protein for every kg you weigh. So if I weigh 180 lbs/82 kgs, I should be taking in approximately 82g of protein a day. I know at the very least that I’m getting 25g of protein from the whey protein on days that I take that.

For Day 1 I was happy to track my meals and the act of tracking my food definitely made me conscious of what I was eating. We went on a family picnic that day so I knew we would be out for a long time but surprisingly I was proactive enough to pack myself some snacks (10 almonds, a pear, and greek yogurt). Normally I would just munch on whatever snacks we had packed for the picnic and also have a beer or two. Think about all those calories!

We ended up having pizza on our way back which is not ideal but it was cut into those small squares and I paced myself. Overall, I was about 131 calories over the budget which takes into account the exercise I had done earlier that day.

### Day 2 - Monday August 17

I remember Day 2 well. It was the first working day and I remember I slept in longer than planned. I missed my morning workout based on the schedule I drafted a few nights before. Normally when this happens I would not exercise at all the rest of the day and the workout would move to the next day. However, I wanted to really make this 21 day challenge work so I made sure to get out for a jog after work.

**Here’s my exercise stats:**

Workout type | Running
Duration | 33 minutes
Distance | 4.8km
Estimated calorie burn | 292

I remember I was finishing up work and it was looking like it got colder and might rain. I ended up wearing a few extra layers and got myself out the door as soon as work was finished. As I was running the weather completely changed! The sun was shining bright and it got hot. I also wasn’t wearing shorts so I felt like the extra layers were holding me back. Even though I had just gone for a jog the day before, it felt so much harder today. I didn’t know what it was but I tried to fight it as much as I could. Again I took breaks and did some walking but still made sure to cover the same distance.

Some negatives from this day’s log include the leftover pizza I had for lunch along with the 6’’ sub.

### Day 3 - Tuesday August 18

Okay so this was my second workday and I had a chance to do better than the day before. I made sure to set my alarms and got myself up out of bed by 7:45am. I started exercising shortly after and it felt good getting the workout in before starting work!

**Here’s my exercise stats:**

Workout type | Running
Duration | 33 minutes
Distance | 4.7km
Estimated calorie burn | 297

Jogging didn’t feel any easier this day and I still had to take breaks. However, I made sure to cover the same distance.

Yes, I was finally under the budget! And looking at the food I ate I don’t see any real red flags unless you consider the cliff bar a bad choice.

### Day 4 - Wednesday August 19

Bad news! This was the day I I forgot to start a workout on my Apple watch and so it didn’t get tracked. But I did work out and I chose to do a workout video at home as I was “tired” of all the jogging. This was a boxing / dance workout video that got the full body moving.

![Photo of Day 4 Meals](/assets/images/week-1/aug_19.png)

The log shows I was over 134 calories but this is because it doesn’t include the calories burned from my workout.

I caved in and enjoyed some pakoras (aloo and paneer)  that afternoon so I would want to avoid those in the future.

### Day 5 - Thursday August 20

I didn’t mention how sore I was each day but I felt it, especially after the first few days of jogging. So again for Thursday I put on a workout video that went over a boxing routine for cardio. This got my entire body moving and I was still sweating buckets!

Another point I want to mention is that the soreness made it hard to get out of bed each morning but I knew I wanted to get that workout in and that it would only be 30 minutes, after that I could do anything I wanted! 

**Here’s my exercise stats:**

Workout type | Workout video at home
Duration | 29 minutes
Estimated calorie burn | 244

![Photo of Day 5 Meals](/assets/images/week-1/aug_20.png)

I went over today! My mom made mini mozzarella and kale pita pizzas for lunch and it was hard to estimate how many calories this was so I just added 3 servings and that totals to over 1000 calories by itself. Otherwise the meals look A-ok! 

Fun fact: I actually got up that morning eager to make something healthy for myself. I looked up a recipe and the first result was Avocado Toast with Sunny Side Eggs. Avocado Toast has been raved about for a while so I thought why not try it out? I also have only had eggs two ways - scrambled or as an omelette. I was feeling a bit adventurous I guess but below you’ll see my attempt at making that dish. I think the takeaway is I had newfound energy and motivation to cook something for myself.

Here's what I wanted to make (mhmm looks so good!):

Here's what I made on the first attempt:

### Day 6 - Friday August 21

I did a morning workout and went out for a bike ride. It felt great and the weather was beautiful! 

**Here’s my exercise stats:**

Workout type | Cycling
Duration | 38 minutes
Distance | 6.9km
Estimated calorie burn | 141

![Photo of Day 6 Meals](/assets/images/week-1/aug_21.png)

I was over by about 61 calories. Okay here comes an excuse - it was Friday so I ended up eating more. This is a bit of a weird scenario but I think it happens to a lot of us. We tend to eat more on weekends. I don’t know why it happens but I think it’s connected to the fact that we tend to have more social outings on Fridays and Saturdays and when we go out we tend to eat more.

For lunch I had homemade nutty fried rice and I found the recipe for it online. The ingredients differed a bit and I had a few servings so it was difficult to estimate the calories but using the app it totaled to just over 700 calories.

That night I also had plans so I went out and got takeout (Chicken tacos) and had a late meal (Chicken patty) once I got home because the tacos weren’t enough.

### Day 7 - Saturday August 22

After cutting the grass and taking care of some errands I made sure to get a workout in before I got ready for the day. I started the workout just before noon and made use of the fitness bands I ordered off of Amazon in quarantine.

I found a great video on YouTube and just followed along for 30 mins while working out with the bands.

**Here’s my exercise stats:**

Workout type | Workout video at home
Duration | 32 minutes
Estimated calorie burn | 192

![Photo of Day 7 Meals](/assets/images/week-1/aug_22.png)

Saturday was a really bad meal day for me. Again I had dinner plans and also had spontaneous plans for a mid-day session at the golf range where I enjoyed a beer.

At dinner I had nachos, one jerk chicken wing, no beers, a clubhouse chicken sandwich, and a very delicious chocolate cake for dessert. The food was great but once I added these into the app later that night, the calories jumped quickly! These are only estimates so the true amount could be even greater. I should also mention that when I had the chance to substitute fries for a salad I didn’t because I wanted the fries! I knew it was wrong but it felt so good in the moment!

Eating better when eating out is going to be something I also work on going forward. I see healthy people on social media eat out all the time so I’m sure there are certain things they watch out for. Maybe they just go out and spend $20-30 on salads? 

### Day 8 - Sunday August 23

I slept in big time on Sunday and didn’t have the motivation to workout in the morning. It was mostly a lazy Sunday but just after dinner I got myself upstairs into gym clothes and put on a workout video. This one was really challenging! I had to do the easier modifications for some of the workouts in the video and the multiple bursts of 30 second mountain climbers throughout the workout were killer. I was sweating 5 minutes into the video and the total workout was only around 20ish minutes but there was a warmup and a cooldown. 

**Here’s my exercise stats:**

Workout type | HIIT workout video
Duration | 26 minutes
Estimated calorie burn | 243

![Photo of Day 8 Meals](/assets/images/week-1/aug_23.png)

Boom! I was under by 200 calories for my last day of the week.

I had leftover pizza for dinner which I knew was a bad choice but I only had a few and still made sure to log it. The first step is tracking and from there I can work on making better choices.

I did try to make the sunny side up eggs on toast again and it was a success! It tasted so good. I can’t believe I was missing out on this my whole life!

### 10 things I've learned in the last week
1. No one cares if I'm doing this or not, it's really up to me to do it.
2. Starting the workout is hard but finishing it feels really good.
3. Tracking my meals isn't that hard if I've already got my phone on me.
4. Body weight exercises and HIIT videos can really make you sweat.
5. I really miss ice cream.
6. Getting the workout in before work gives me more time in the evenings for other things.
7. I'm more careful about what I'm eating just because I've started tracking the food.
8. I don't have a consistent meal plan which makes me more likely to make bad choices when deciding what to eat
9. The process is slow but you just have to get your checkmark for the day. The results will come.
10. Week 1 is down and I'm feeling good!

That’s all for this week!

JB
